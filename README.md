# burger

This is a simple restaurant app build with node express, mysql, and handlebars.

It follows the MVC pattern, with a model, views, controller.

The model calls out to an ORM to get, add, and update data in mysql database.

Here's a quick video to see how it works: https://youtu.be/oBvhrPkMDsc

One thing to note, is the app does have a slightly different behavior on mobile.

I decided to remove the list of devoured burgers, as people on their phone
will be most likely trying to devour a burger quicky, or else order a new one and devour it.

A quick shoud out to Michael Bethencourt's [CatsAppSolution](http://ucb.bootcampcontent.com/UCB-Coding-Bootcamp/01-17-Class-Content/commits/master/TH-Class-Content/14-node-express-handlebars/1-Class-Content/14.3/Activities/11-CatsAppSolution/config).

Much poetic license was taken in 'learning' (borrowing) from this app!
