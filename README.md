# burger

This is a simple restaurant app built with node express, mysql, and handlebars.

It follows the MVC pattern, with a model, views, controller.

The model calls out to an ORM to get, add, and update data in mysql database.

And I finally got the app to upload to heroku! Woot: [https://shielded-fjord-10052.herokuapp.com/](https://shielded-fjord-10052.herokuapp.com/).

Before I was able to push to heroku, I made a video too: [https://youtu.be/oBvhrPkMDsc](https://youtu.be/oBvhrPkMDsc)

One thing to note: the app behaves slightly differently on mobile.

I decided to remove the list of devoured burgers, as people on their phone
will be most likely trying to devour a burger quicky, or else order a new one and devour it.

And finally, a quick shout out to Michael Bethencourt's

Much poetic license was taken in 'learning' (borrowing) from this app!
